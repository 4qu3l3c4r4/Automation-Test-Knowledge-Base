Simple Hybrid (Python + Robotframework) Page Object Example

I've used as a base adamgoucher's code (https://github.com/adamgoucher/robotframework-pageobjects)
And fixed path's so it can be usable by RobotFramework (http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-physical-path-to-library)

Just needed to fix path for PageObject inside scripts/common_resource.robot so it can be reachable by RB.
